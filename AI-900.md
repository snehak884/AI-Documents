### Exam Day Tips

**Before the Exam:**
- Get good sleep the night before
- Review responsible AI principles
- Quick scan of Azure service names and capabilities
- Review this study guide summary

**During the Exam:**
- Read questions carefully
- Look for keywords (classify, detect, generate, predict)
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Mark difficult questions for review
- Time management (1-1.5 minutes per question)

**Common Traps:**
- Confusing similar services (Vision vs Face)
- Mixing up supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Wrong ML technique for use case
- Forgetting responsible AI principles

### Key Service Differentiators

**When to use Azure AI Vision vs Face:**
- **Vision:** General object detection, OCR, image analysis
- **Face:** Specifically facial detection, recognition, attributes

**Regression vs Classification:**
- **Regression:** Predict number (price, age, temperature)
- **Classification:** Predict category (spam/not spam, cat/dog)

**AutoML vs Azure ML:**
- **AutoML:** Automated, no code, quick start
- **Azure ML:** Full control, custom code, advanced features

**Azure OpenAI vs Other AI Services:**
- **OpenAI:** Generative AI, conversational, creative
- **Other Services:** Specific tasks (vision, speech, language analysis)

### Final Checklist

✅ Understand all six responsible AI principles  
✅ Know difference between regression, classification, clustering
